The project website, (www.maregraph.eu) has gone live on M6 (June 2023) and has been developed as a central place for organizational and navigation of documents for project partners, not necessarily the general public. The Flanders Marine Insitute (VLIZ) will manage the MareGraph project and will be updating it on regular basis.   

Project partners who might have feedback on the site or wish to upload materials, news, or events to the website (e.g., calendar) should contact VLIZ (info@maregraph.eu) and inform them about any major changes. Any minor changes such as typo-s, spelling, etc., may be adjusted without any consultation from VLIZ.
