- [WP4 - Architecture Overview](https://zenodo.org/records/10083644)
A session to introduce WP4 data architecture for the project. This gathering aimed to conduct an informative session on MareGraph's architecture whitepaper and extend the invitation to both the consortium and the wider community for feedback and comments. The presentation was given by Julián Rojas from Ghent University - IMEC. We aim to facilitate discussions and gather valuable feedback from the community.

- [WP5 WoRMs/LOD Implementation Plan Presentation](https://zenodo.org/records/10083478)  
A short introduction session on Deliverable 5.1: WoRMS/LOD Gap Analysis, led by work package 5: Technical implementation (VLIZ). A general introduction ('30mins) but the nature of the topic touches upon technical aspects. This report brings the ideas of D4.1: Architecture whitepaper into practice and will create an opportunity early on for ideas we may have missed. This intro session might be particularly interesting to EmodnetBio phase 5 because D5.1 may serve as a template for providing an LDES feed for the bodc-nerc-vocab resp for SeaDataNet linked open data.


- [D5.1 - WoRMS/LOD Gap Analysis](https://zenodo.org/records/8354364)
This document prepares on deliverable D5.2 (WoRMS/LOD implementation) by listing up the essential parts that need to be developed together with some motivation and attention to important detail. It does so by considering the current state of the existing WoRMS data management system (Aphia) as well as the recently made available D4.1 (Architecture whitepaper) and the upcoming D3.1, D3.2 (Preliminary resp. Final Ontology design and development). It is targeted to be a clear guide towards implementation for the developers as well as a concise description of what services can be expected by consuming parties upon delivery of D5.2

- [D4.1 - Architecture Whitepaper](https://zenodo.org/records/8318832)
This white paper provides a conceptual and technical background around the motivations for the conception of the MareGraph project. It also describes the rationale for the technical design choices made to support the proposed reference architecture that is detailed here. Finally, hints towards some open technical challenges.

- [D2.1 Guidelines on process and methodology for organisational interoperability (Version 1](https://zenodo.org/records/8167337)
MareGraph aims to bring together and collaborate with highly diverse national and regional 
Research Infrastructure (RIs) in Europe. To maximize the impact of MareGraph and its results, 
the project implements effective communication, dissemination and knowledge transfer 
methodology and strategies. Having a defined process and methodology for organizational 
interoperability is crucial as it ensures seamless communication, data exchange, and 
collaboration between different departments, systems, and organizations, thereby enhancing 
efficiency, reducing errors, and enabling effective decision-making. This document stems from the ICEG process and methodology, which in turn was the English translation of the OSLO process and methodology. The process focuses on the harmonization and alignment of initiatives with the goal of developing ontologies across borders in the EU.


- [D3.1 – Preliminary ontology design and development](https://zenodo.org/records/10849372)
This document presents the initial versions of the ontologies created in MAREGRAPH, which 
are needed to represent the data stored in the WoRMS database in Linked Open Data, thus 
increasing semantic interoperability for identified high-value data. The document provides a description of the ontologies produced, which can be viewed as  modular ontology modules linked together, forming the so-called APHIA ontology network. 
The modularisation approach that covers different aspects of marine species data (e.g., taxa names, geographical distributions, attributes and traits) allows for flexibility and adaptation  of the data models to specific needs.
