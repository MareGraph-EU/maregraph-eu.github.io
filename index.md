## About
With MAREGRAPH, we aim atsupporting the EU and its MemberStatesin the achievement of ambitious marine themed
objectives by semantically enriching, interlinking and providing high value and foundational datasets. These currently
power the "effective biodiversity and conservation knowledge products" of today and will enable building the knowledge
products of the future, where knowledge graphs and AI closely interact to support the marine public sector in making and
building open knowledge on marine biodiversity. The MAREGRAPH project will provide an open linked data production
and publication of three high impact datasets in the marine domain (the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS),
Marine Regions and EurOBIS (the European Node of the international Ocean Biodiversity Information System) using
state of the art technologies. This will allow the onboarding of essential marine datasets in the Common European Data
Spaces. As such MAREGRAPH will provide a structural component in the digital transition of the marine landscape
