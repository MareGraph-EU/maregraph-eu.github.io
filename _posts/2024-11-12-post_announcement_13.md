## MareGraph submitted on Public Sector Tech Watch

The Public Sector Tech Watch (PSTW) observatory launched in 2024 the â€˜Best Cases Awardâ€™. The aim was to spotlight solutions using emerging technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, etc.) in public administrations at all levels to enhance public services for citizens (G2C) or to improve their internal processes (G2G). On the one hand, the award aimed to generate a virtuous mechanism for sharing the best experiences on the use of emerging technologies in the public sector; and on the other, to give visibility to the most innovative public administrations in Europe.
