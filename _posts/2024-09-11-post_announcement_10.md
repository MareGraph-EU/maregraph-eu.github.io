We are pleased to announce that our [Data Models Charter](https://www.maregraph.eu/files/Charter_Maregraph_OSLO.pdf) has been recently updated to reflect key adjustments in the timeline and schedule of events and milestones. This revision ensures that our roadmap stays aligned with evolving project needs and priorities.

## What's New?
**Adjusted Timeline:** Key events and milestones, such as our Thematic Workshops on [EurOBIS](https://www.eurobis.org/), have been rescheduled to accommodate changes in project dependencies and workflows. The different phases of the data models production lifecycle have been slightly realigned to better reflect current progress and future goals.

We encourage all stakeholders to review the updated [Data Models Charter](https://www.maregraph.eu/files/Charter_Maregraph_OSLO.pdf) to stay informed about the latest developments and the adjusted schedule.
