On behalf of the overall consortium of MAREGRAPH, coordinated by the Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ), we extended a warm invitation for participation in the first series of workshops organized as part of our project. These workshops are designed to bring together stakeholders who share a keen interest in the domain.  

The primary objective of these workshops is to gather essential requirements from domain experts, particularly concerning the modelling and representation of data related to the WoRMS information system (taxonomic data), Marine Regions, and the EUROBIS system. 

If you are interested in participating in future workshops, we kindly request you to register using the following [form](https://forms.office.com/r/wLtUHJWVh7) or emailing <info@maregraph.eu>.
