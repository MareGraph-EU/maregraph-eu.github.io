We’re pleased to announce the release of Deliverable D2.4, summarizing the dissemination efforts of the MareGraph project up to June 2025. This report highlights the many events, webinars, workshops, and digital activities carried out by the project partners to share our results with diverse audiences.

Our multi-channel dissemination strategy includes a dedicated website, active social media presence, open-source GitHub repositories, and a public data catalog compliant with European standards. These efforts have helped maximize the project’s visibility and engagement.

Looking ahead, MareGraph will release its integrated Knowledge Graph by the project’s end, combining key marine biodiversity data to support future research and collaboration.
