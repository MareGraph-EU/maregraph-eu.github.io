## 🌊 Project MareGraph: results webinar

After three years of collaboration, Project MareGraph has been successfully completed. To wrap up the project, the consortium is hosting a public webinar to present and demonstrate its key outcomes from a researcher’s perspective.

MareGraph is about connecting important marine databases (EurOBIS, WoRMS, MarineRegions) into one smart, interlinked system so computers can ‘understand’ how species, places, and observations in the ocean relate to each other. By doing this, it becomes much easier for scientists, policymakers, and even AI tools to discover, combine, and reuse marine knowledge to better understand and protect our seas.


During the webinar, we’ll run a live demo highlighting the project’s main results: new dataset formats and services, open-source tools and code libraries, reusable ontologies, and an international semantics governance workflow.

·                👩‍🔬👨‍💻 For who? Marine researchers, data managers, infrastructure developers, and anyone interested in linked data and knowledge graphs with EurOBIS, WoRMS, and Marine Regions. 

·                👉 Join us to see what MareGraph delivers — and how its results can be reused beyond the project.

·                When: March 3rd, 14:00 - 15:30 (1 hour demo and explanation + 30 mins Q&A)
