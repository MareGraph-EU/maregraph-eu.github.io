 **A Week of Progress and Collaboration** 

Last week marked a significant milestone for Project MargeGraphs as we reached the halfway point of our project. The team gathered for the General Assembly and showcased our innovations at the SEMIC pre-conference and conference in Brussels.

*General Assembly Highlights*

In sunny Brussels, the General Assembly took place with the presence of our project officer, Riku LeppÃ¤nen. This meeting was an opportunity to review our progress, refine our strategies, and prepare for the SEMIC 2024 events. The assembly also provided a platform for strengthening collaboration among our project partners.

*SEMIC Conference*

The [SEMIC 2024](https://semic2024.eu/) conference, hosted by the European Commission in partnership with the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and our project partners from Digital Flanders, was a focal point of our week. Our preparations during the General Assembly ensured that we were ready to showcase MargeGraphs to a wider audience. The conference itself spanned two days, offering numerous opportunities to present our work, engage in discussions, and build new connections.
[MareGraph](https://www.maregraph.eu/) was presented during the session 'Cross-border Semantic Interoperability: From Models Discovery and Design to Implementation and Reuse'. The project is aimed at revolutionizing European interoperability. ðŸš€MareGraph enhances seamless data exchange, breaking down communication barriers across Europeâ€™s digital systems. 

Our presentation showcased the vison for European collaboration with the [OSLO](https://www.vlaanderen.be/digitaal-vlaanderen/onze-oplossingen/oslo) method and lessons learned. Thank you to Raf Buyle, Eveline Vlassenroot, and Giorgia Lodi for the great presentation.
