Project MareGraph Successfully Completed 🎉

After three years of collaboration and innovation, Project MareGraph has officially come to an end. The project concluded in December 2025, having successfully delivered 15 deliverables and reached 7 key milestones. It has been a pleasure working within such a small yet highly impactful consortium.

We’re happy to share that the final deliverables are now publicly available on Zenodo:

- **D4.4 – LDES-based Web Indexes <https://zenodo.org/communities/maregraph/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest>

- **D5.4 – EurOBIS/LOD <https://zenodo.org/communities/maregraph/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest>

These publications represent the culmination of our collective efforts and provide concrete outcomes for the community to build upon.

Curious to see MareGraph’s results in action? Join us for our end-of-project public webinar on March 3rd (14:00–15:30). We’ll demonstrate how to use the Linked Open Data through practical use cases, followed by an open Q&A session with our work package leaders.

Stay tuned—we look forward to sharing and celebrating the results with you!
