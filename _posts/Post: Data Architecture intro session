Following a highly productive General Assembly of project MareGraph, we believe it would be beneficial to organize a dissemination and presentation session to introduce WP4 (Data Architecture). The purpose of this gathering is to conduct an informative session on MareGraph's Architecture whitepaper and extend the invitation to both the consortium and the wider community.

We aim to facilitate discussions and gather valuable feedback during this event
