We’re excited to share the **final release of the ontologies developed under the MAREGRAPH project**—an essential step forward in unlocking the full potential of marine biodiversity data. These ontologies enable **Linked Open Data** representations for both the *World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)* and the *European Ocean Biodiversity Information System (EurOBIS)*, dramatically enhancing semantic interoperability across key marine datasets. 

Building on earlier work, this release introduces critical updates, a **brand-new Marine Observations ontology** tailored to biodiversity data, and robust **SHACL shapes for validation**—ensuring both flexibility and precision. Altogether, the MAREGRAPH ontology suite now includes **five domain-specific modules and a top-level ontology** grounded in foundational frameworks like DOLCE. 

This milestone marks a major leap toward more open, connected, and reusable marine data, with all resources publicly available and actively maintained at [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/MareGraph-EU/assets).
