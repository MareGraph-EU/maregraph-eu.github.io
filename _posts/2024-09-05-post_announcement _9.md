 We are proud to be represented at the SPNHC & TDWG Joint Conference in Okinawa, Japan. Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) develops and maintains data standards that support the integration of primary biodiversity information across disciplines, organizations, and nations. Its annual conference has become a preeminent forum for advancing biodiversity informatics. Our partner, Alessandro Russo, presented during SYM14 "Emergence of Integrated Public Collection Services" on European MAREGRAPH project: enhancing marine data interoperability through semantic knowledge graphs.
