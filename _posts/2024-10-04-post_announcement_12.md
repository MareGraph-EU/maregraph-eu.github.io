## 🌐 Recap of the EurOBIS/LOD Implementation Plan Presentation from WP5

Today, VLIZ presented the implementation plan for the EurOBIS Linked Open Data (LOD). The report outlines the expected features and service interface points for the new components to be developed. It takes into account the current state of the EurOBIS database system and workflow, 
alongside the overall planned architecture detailed in the [D4.1 Whitepaper](https://zenodo.org/records/8318832).

The goal is to serve as both a development guide and a concise description of the new services that the LOD and LDES publications of EurOBIS will offer.
