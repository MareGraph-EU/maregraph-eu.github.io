📣 Important Announcement: Modification to MareGraph Project Charter

Dear Members of the MareGraph Community,

We would like to inform you of a slight modification to the MareGraph Project Charter, necessitated related to the modeling components of the data stored in WoRMS. In consideration of upcoming holidays, we have decided to make an adjustment to the timeline of our activities.

Please take note of the following changes:

- 2nd Thematic Workshop on WoRMS - 19th of October 2023
- Start of the public review - 22th of November 2023
- End of the public review - 22th of December 2023
- Final release end of January, according to our gantt in the project

These adjustments are aimed at ensuring the quality and accuracy of our work, even during holiday periods.

Thank you for your understanding and commitment to the success of MareGraph.
