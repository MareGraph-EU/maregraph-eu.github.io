## MareGraph - Meets in Rome for the second to last time
Today, overlooking the Basilica di Santa Maria in Montesanto, the MareGraph consortium gathers in Italy for our second-to-last General Assembly, hosted by our partners at CNR - Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione. ðŸŒŠ 

Over two productive days of planning and workshops, weâ€™ve laid out the roadmap for the final six months of our 3-year project. Highlights ahead include: 

- The release of MareGraphâ€™s final ontology design and development â€“ coming next month 
- The publication of EurOBIS as Linked Open Data â€“ expected this December 

Weâ€™re proud of the milestones ahead and grateful for the collaboration driving this work forward.
