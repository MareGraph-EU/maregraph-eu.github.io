ðŸ“£ We are excited to announce the launch of the **public review** for the first set of **ontologies** developed within the MAREGRAPH project! 
These ontologies aim to represent the rich data offered by the [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/) (WoRMS) system in a standardized and machine-readable format.

We encourage all interested parties to participate in this review; also, feel free to share it with your colleagues who you think might be willing to provide feedback.

In the project, we have set up an issue template for the "assets" repository of the [MAREGRAPH GitHub](https://github.com/MareGraph-EU/assets).
You can use this template to submit specific issues you encounter with the ontologies. In the template of the issue, there is also a reference to the corresponding [deliverable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10849372) where some motivations for design choices are reported.

The public review period will be open until the **30th of June 2024**, starting from today 15 May. We encourage you to submit your contributions as soon as possible to ensure they are considered during the finalization process.

Have a look at the dedicated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MareGraph-EU/assets) and have your say!

Looking forward to your feedback!
